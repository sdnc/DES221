                    <p>
                        The design idea behind this banner is to create a word cloud containing important
                        design terms, specifically ones that are relevant to the USC course offerings. The
                        two hands reaching out to each other represent team work and unity.

                    <h2>Icon Banner</h2>
                    <img src="img/AustraliaDesignBanner.jpg" alt="Banner with icons">

                    <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
                    <p>
                        The idea behind this banner is similar to the one of the word cloud, but 
                        instead of using words, icons are taken in use. These icons represent various design concepts as well as containing some Australia themed icons in
                        regards to the University location.

                        This last design contains an abstract background image with Design@USC text presented
                        in a funky manner. I believe that art does not always have to express something specific,
                        but that creativity and inspiration can be sparked through lively colors, shapes and patterns.
